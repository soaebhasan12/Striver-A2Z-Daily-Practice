# Selection Sort

"""
Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in non-decreasing order using the selection sort algorithm and return the sorted array.

A sorted array in non-decreasing order is an array where each element is greater than or equal to all previous elements in the array.

Example 1
Input: nums = [7, 4, 1, 5, 3]
Output: [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]
Explanation: 1 <= 3 <= 4 <= 5 <= 7.
Thus the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.


Example 2
Input: nums = [5, 4, 4, 1, 1]
Output: [1, 1, 4, 4, 5]
Explanation: 1 <= 1 <= 4 <= 4 <= 5.
Thus the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
