# 🧠 What is Recursion?

Recursion is when a function calls itself
to solve a smaller version of the same problem.

Example:

Sum of first 3 numbers:

3 + 2 + 1

Mathematically:

sum(3) = 3 + sum(2)
sum(2) = 2 + sum(1)
sum(1) = 1 + sum(0)
sum(0) = 0

This breakdown is recursion.

---

# 🔥 Two Golden Rules

## 1️⃣ Base Case

Stopping condition.
Without it → infinite function calls → Stack Overflow Error.

## 2️⃣ Reduction Step

Each call must move closer to base case.

n → n-1
5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 0

If problem size does not reduce, recursion never ends.

# 📦 What Happens Behind the Scenes?

When a function calls itself:

The previous function does NOT disappear.

It waits inside memory.
This memory structure is called the **Call Stack**.

Example:

fun(3)
→ fun(2)
→ fun(1)
→ fun(0)

Stack builds downward.

When base case is reached,
stack starts resolving upward.

This creates two phases:

- Down Phase (stack building)
- Up Phase (calculation happens)

---

# ⬇️ Down Phase vs ⬆️ Up Phase

If code is:

```python
print(n)
test(n-1)
```

Print happens during down phase.

If code is:

```python
test(n-1)
print(n)
```

Print happens during up phase.

Golden Rule:

- Code before recursive call → executes going down
- Code after recursive call → executes coming up

---

# 🔁 Return Value Flow

Example:

```python
def sum_n(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    return n + sum_n(n-1)
```

For n = 3:

Down phase creates:

3 + ?
2 + ?
1 + ?
0

Up phase calculates:

1 + 0 = 1
2 + 1 = 3
3 + 3 = 6

Final Answer = 6

Important:

Base case does not just stop recursion.
It defines the starting value of the final answer.

# ⚠️ Common Beginner Mistakes

- Forgetting base case
- Wrong base condition
- Not reducing input
- Calling function without modifying argument
- Not understanding stack behavior

---

# ⏳ Time Complexity (Linear Recursion)

For n calls:

fun(n)
fun(n-1)
fun(n-2)
...
fun(0)

Total calls ≈ n

Time Complexity: O(n)

This is linear recursion (single branch).

# 📝 Memory Version (Quick Revision)

Recursion Template:

```python
def func(n):
    if base_case:
        return value

    return work + func(smaller_input)
```

Checklist for every problem:

- What is base case?
- How is problem reducing?
- Is work happening in down phase or up phase?
- What does base case return?
